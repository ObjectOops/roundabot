Hotspot commands.

systemctl status NetworkManager
systemctl start NetworkManager
sudo nmcli device wifi hotspot ssid p-hotspot password ketchup_57 ifname wlan0

Don't be silly. I changed the password.

sudo nmcli connection modify f7444c23-4355-4694-8fa1-58a4f562a032 connection.autoconnect yes connection.autoconnect-priority 100

For the command above, the defaults are "no" and "0", respectively.
